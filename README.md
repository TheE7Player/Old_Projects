# Higher Lower (2018) #
HigherLower.zip is a project based on the TV show "Play Your Cards Right" where cards are faced against you.

It's up to you to decide if the next card facing down is higher or lower then the current faced-up card is.

This game has a scoring system (Based on money, don't ask why). Can you get all 6 cards correct?

# IO Panel (2018)  #
ioPanel.zip is a project for income. It allows you to input payments and it will track the information. That's mostly it... funny enough.

# Word of Tanks Server Tracker (2019)  #
WOT_APIOnlineDemo.zip is a more recent project which tracks the amount of players in WOT RU servers.
It also contains the chart of the players over time.

This project isn't complete at it's finest and can be improved upon.
