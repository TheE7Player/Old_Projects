C# Projects (Some new and old)
=
Here are a list of my old projects for people to look at, these won't be edited.
This projects may not be optimised and may differ different programming techniques for each project.
# NOTE #
*These projects may or may not be finished to its full potential, These are just for practical and demonstration reasons.*

The executables may be found inside the project folder inside the bin folder, either under Debug or Release.

# Higher Lower (2018) #
HigherLower.zip is a project based on the TV show "Play Your Cards Right" where cards are faced against you.

It's up to you to decide if the next card facing down is higher or lower then the current faced-up card is.

This game has a scoring system (Based on money, don't ask why). Can you get all 6 cards correct?

# IO Panel (2018)  #
ioPanel.zip is a project for income. It allows you to input payments and it will track the information. 
That's mostly it... funny enough.

# Word of Tanks Server Tracker (2019)  #
WOT_APIOnlineDemo.zip is a more recent project which tracks the amount of players in WOT RU servers.
It also contains the chart of the players over time.

This project isn't complete at it's finest and can be improved upon.

# Web Scraping Project (2020) #
With much interest with pythons "beautifulsoup" library - I made a choice to see if C# can do a thing!
It uses [HTML Agility Pack](https://html-agility-pack.net/) to handle the process of scanning the html file...

Target: My local cinemas webpage to look at the current films, [Link right here!](https://waterfrontcinema.savoysystems.co.uk/WaterfrontCinema.dll/)

What the program targets:

 - Each films:
	 - Title
	 - Description
	 - Age rating (UK Standard)
	 - Film Cover URL
	 - Dates with available shown times (1 to 3 showings)

Goal: To write a WPF app with neat animations with this project - so I'll need to convert this into an C# library!

*Below is a demo of what it outputs (Data is accurate as of 1/1/2020 )*

![Console output of available films and their showing dates and time! (1/1/20)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheE7Player/Old_Projects/master/images/ws.png)

I'll soon make a pdf guide on how I achieved this - I only just learned the library today (1/1/20)!
